# Introduction

This Physical Data Design Document provides a comprehensive description
of the physical data structure and process design for the Licensing
Self-Certification Portal (LSCP) Project. This document serves as a
blueprint for the implementation of the LSCP database, ensuring a robust
and efficient data management system.

The document delves into the detailed relationships between key business
entities within the LSCP. A clear and concise diagrammatic
representation is provided to visually illustrate the connections
between these entities. This section also includes a comprehensive
description of each entity, its attributes, and the data types used to
represent them. The data relationships are further explained,
highlighting the primary keys, foreign keys, and any constraints imposed
on the data.

By providing a detailed understanding of the physical data structure,
this document serves as a valuable resource for developers, database
administrators, and other stakeholders involved in the implementation
and maintenance of the LSCP.

#  

# Objectives

The objectives of the proposed Licensing Self-Certification Portal
(LSCP) should:

1.  Provide user-friendly and meaningful messages to users.

2.  Store all electronic and paper submissions from applicant and
    > authorized person (AP)/registered structural engineer (RSE)
    > applications of the requisite safety certificates for registration
    > of non-purpose built schools and child care centres, and
    > applications in related to non-purpose non-local higher and
    > professional education courses.

3.  BD departmental portal login for internal users (BD), and provide
    > User ID and password as an alternative.

4.  Support the latest web browsers.

5.  Comply with the standards of the Government System Architecture and
    > government IT security policy.

## Physical Data Structure Specification

This section documents the data model and its associated descriptions of
the required system.

##  Physical Data Structure

An entity-relationship diagram consists of three basic elements such as
entity, relationship, and attribute. Along with these are more
components based on their main elements like weak entity, multi-valued
attribute, and many more. Notations used to make ERD diagram examples
include cardinality and ordinality to define relationships in numbers.

There are 7 categories of entities in the data model design.

-   (CGIS) Frontend - Application Forms submission

-   (CGIS) Frontend - OTP login control

-   Backend - Users

-   Backend - Workflow of Application Forms submission

### (GCIS) Frontend - Application Forms Submission

# Data Entity Description

This section states the conversion rules, the assumptions applied for
the physical data design, the names of the physical data tables, the
corresponding required system entities and key details to be stored into
the database.

The database is a physical store of contract related information and
textual data inside a database management system (DBMS). For LSCP,
<span class="mark">Microsoft SQL Server 2019</span> is selected for the
database management system. <span class="mark">All the spatial and
textual entity will be stored into Microsoft SQL Server 2019.</span>

The following tables document how the Logical Data Model (LDM) can be
mapped onto the physical data design.

<span class="mark">(RY Note: following table needs to review its
correctness)</span>
