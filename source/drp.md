#  INTRODUCTION

> The Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) defines the disaster recovery
> procedures in case the system of pilot project of self-certification
> system (SCS) for Buildings Department (BD) is being interrupted. It
> contains the information needed to post-interruption decision-making
> and the response to any disruptive or extended interruption of the
> system's normal operations and services.
>
> This document should be updated whenever there is any change in the
> hardware, software, operation procedure, and responsible party of the
> system. Moreover, regular drill should be conducted to ensure the
> procedures are correct and workable and this document should be
> reviewed after every Disaster Recovery (DR) drill.

# BACKUP STRATEGY

> Offsite backup is the process of transferring data from primary site
> to a separate storage device, i.e. de-duplicated backup disk at DR
> site. If the original data is lost or damaged, the data restoration
> from the backup disk could help the system switch the operation to DR
> site to sustain the service at an acceptable degraded level.
>
> The backup includes following:

-   Data; and

-   Data File (e.g. supporting document of Form A, Form B or Quality
    Supervision Form, Generated report)

> Application backup is not necessary, because the application
> installation or update will be installed on both Production and DR
> sites every single time.

1.   [DATA BACKUP]{.smallcaps}

> At least two types of data should be backed up. They are:

-   Database

-   Data File

> The data stored in the MSSQL will be stored in local storage and copy
> through Veeam to DR site by scheduler and script setup on Production
> server

1.  \
    [SYSTEM BACKUP]{.smallcaps}

> As the system should not have many changes regularly, it is
> recommended to perform a full system image backup after any system
> patching.
>
> Backup will be run by Veeam and backup to SAN storage. Veeam
> Replication will be run from SAN storage to Dell Data Domain to store
> the SAN data. There is also a weekly backup job to backup data to
> tape.
>
> The following system image of servers will be backup:
>
> prd-scs-log-01
>
> prd-scs-esetnod32
>
> prd-scs-proxy
>
> prd-scs-filer

[GCIS environment]{.underline}

Because of the DR nature of GCIS (P1/P2 architecture), no physical
hardware is used for DR.

##  DISASTER RECOVERY

### Backup the VM from Production VM (Initial/One Time)

The DR's VMs will be installed and configured via restore related VM
snapshot of Production on LSCP Backup Server via Veeam.

###  Recovery Data & Data Files

The Database BAK file will be daily backup and copied from production to
DR site by Scheduler and programming script.

The Data File (e.g. supporting documents and submission forms) files
will be daily batch backup from production to DR site by Scheduler and
programming script.

The backup database and data files will be stored on PRD ( D:\\backup)

via Veeam copy to DR VM & Path (D:\\backup), it will be manual restored
if need to setup DR

### Config DR backup Server static route and IP address

The DR's VMs will be installed and configured and parallel run with
below URL and IP.

DR URL
[[www1.[scs.bd.ccgo.hksarg]{.mark}]{.underline}](http://www1.scs.bd.ccgo.hksarg)

IP 10.5.174.245

No DNS required for additional configuration for DR restore, just notice
users to use DR URL to visit DR web application.

[GCIS]{.underline}

The DR's VMs will be installed and configured and parallel run with
below URL and IP.

DR URL [[www1.scs.bd.gov.hk]{.mark}](http://www1.scs.bd.gov.hk)

# PLANNING FOR DISASTER RECOVERY DRILL

##  STAGE 0 -- SITE READINESS

### Network Connection

1.  Make sure all switches are powered on.

2.  Make sure all network cables are connected properly.

3.  Try reset the switch by unplug and reconnect power if the above
    procedure didn't help.

### Server Status Check

1.  Login to the DR servers by sharepoint administrator account.

2.  Open "Event Viewer" inside "Programs ð¡ª Administration Tools".

3.  Check all the "Warning" and "Error" logs.

> 4\. Report to SM&S contractor for any warnings and errors found to see
> if they have adverse impacts to CDPSS.

##  STAGE 1 -- SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT SET UP TEST

###  Procedure to start-up the DR DB Server 

1.  After Power on the server, make sure the below service is in a
    "Running" state

> "SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)"

### Procedure to start-up the DR Web Server

1.  After Power on the server, make sure the below service is in a
    "Running" state

> "Office Online"

2.  If the service is not in a "Running" state, start the service
    manually.

### Procedure to start-up the DR Backend Server

1.  After Power on the server, make sure the below service is in a
    "Running" state

> "Office Online"

2.  If the service is not in a "Running" state, start the service
    manually.

### Procedure to start-up the DR API Server

1.  After Power on the server, make sure the below service is in a
    "Running" state

> "Office Online"

2.  If the service is not in a "Running" state, start the service
    manually.

##  STAGE 2 -- APPLICATION SYSTEM TEST

###  Procedure to test Frontend (GCIS)

1.  Before the DR test date, create a record in the frontend

2.  On DR day, check both
    [[https://www2.scs.bd.gov.hk/]{.underline}](https://cdpssdr.bd.gov.hk/)
    and
    [[https://www2.scs.bd.gov.hk/api]{.underline}](https://www2.scs.bd.gov.hk/api)
    are accessible

3.  Check if the record from 1. exists in those environments

### Procedure to test Backend Portal

On DR day, make sure the LSCP backend can be accessed by: {backend
domain} or {OSDP}
