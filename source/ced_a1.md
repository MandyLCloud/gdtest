# CURRENT ENVIRONMENT DESCRIPTION

## CURRENT SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

Being one of the skeleton government departments in different types of
licensing regimes in Hong Kong, Buildings Department (BD) is responsible
to provide expert advice on building and structural safety matters for
issuance of license. In addition to formulate building safety
requirements to the LA for incorporating into the Letter of Requirement
(LoR) for obtaining a license, BD is required to undertake the full
compliance checks which involve both document checks and site checks for
various licensing regimes such as Educational Premises (EP), Child Care
Centre (CCC), Places of Amusement (PA), and amusement game centre (AGC).

**Registration for non-purpose built educational premises and child care
centre**

Regarding the licensing regime for EP, at present, an application for
registration of EP in premises not designed and constructed for the
purposes of a school should be accompanied by three certificates issued
by the Director of Buildings (DB) under section 12(1)(a), (b) and (ca)
of the Education Ordinance (Cap. 279) (EO) and a notice issued by the
Building Authority (BA) under section 12(1)(d) of the same Ordinance.
Similarly, an application for registration of CCC should be accompanied
by certificates issued by the DB under section 7(1)(b) of the Child Care
Services Ordinance (Cap. 243) (CCSO).

> In applying for the requisite certificates and notice for EP
> registration, applicants have to submit the application form together
> with 4 copies of premises layout plans showing the layout of the
> premises directly to BD for processing. Upon receipt of the
> applications, BD will, based on the proposed layout plan, conduct
> desktop study and site inspection to ascertain the suitability of the
> premises for use as EP. If the premises are found suitable from
> building safety perspective, the requisite certificates and notice
> will be issued to the applicant. Otherwise, a LoR listing out all the
> building safety requirements will be issued to the applicant and
> copied to the Education Bureau (EDB) for their rectification. Upon
> receipt of notification from the applicant for the completion of
> building safety requirements, BD will carry out compliance checks.
> When all the imposed building safety requirements are complied with,
> BD will endorse 4 sets of plans and issue the requisite certificates
> and notice, to the applicant.
>
> Regarding applications for CCC registration, BD will process the
> referrals from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) similar to those
> for EP registration, except BD will provide input to SWD direct for
> incorporation into the LoR.

In addition, applicants may carry out alteration work in registered EP
and CCC to cope with their operational needs, 4 sets of the alteration
plans will be submitted to the LA for seeking BD’s comments as
necessary. In general, BD will process the referrals similar to new
registration applications.

> **Temporary Places of Public Entertainment License (TPPEL)**

Also, BD is responsible to offer building safety comments to FEHD in
respect of a TPPEL application. In support of each application, the
applicant is required to submit the proposed layout plans, information
of proprietary temporary structures or standard design of temporary
structures, structural justifications (only required when certain
dimensional requirements have exceeded), etc. for BD's comment
regardless of whether or not such temporary structures have been used in
the same location under different applications. According to the past
experience, same proprietary temporary structures or standard design of
temporary structures often reuse for different events in the same
locations. All supporting documents are also kept in the case paper
files.

1.  <span id="_Toc100670911" class="anchor"></span>Volumes and
    Frequencies

BD received a total of 2689, 3008, 3618 cases in relation to the license
applications for EP, CCC and TPPEL in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively.
There is a continuous rising trend on the number of license applications
and it is anticipated that the estimated growth rate of the applications
is about 10% per annum.
