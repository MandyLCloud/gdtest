# 1. Purpose

The Computer Operating Procedures Manual (COPM) provides information and
operating instructions related to the operation of the computer system.
The intended users are the operating staff of the relevant section.

This manual is not intended to be a complete replacement of the formal
technical publication as issued by the manufacturer. However,
information and instructions documented in the manual would be specific
to the installation and should take precedence over the manufacturer?s
counterparts or details.

# 2. Scope

This document is to be used as a guide for operating the system. It
addresses the tasks that need to be monitored by the administrator to
make sure that the system is functioned properly.

# 3. Reference

-   System Installation Plan
-   Application Operation Manual

# 4. Definitions and Conventions

## 4.1 Definitions

None.

## 4.2 Conventions

The following acronyms are used in the text of this document:

**Note:**

-   [TODO] markers indicate sections where specific details are missing from the input files and need to be filled in from the original documentation or system knowledge.
-   The "Content of..." placeholders should be replaced with the corresponding content extracted from the input text files.
-   The table of contents is automatically generated based on the headings in the document.
-   Ensure to review and complete the "[TODO]" sections with accurate and up-to-date information.
-   This is a basic structure, and you may need to adjust it further based on the complete content and specific requirements for the manual.
-   For table contents, I will list out the headings and subheadings. You can manually create the links if needed.
-   For code blocks, I will use markdown code fences (```) to format them.
-   For tables, I will use markdown table syntax.
-   For images, I will use markdown image syntax, assuming the images are available in a "media/" directory relative to the Markdown file. If images are not available, remove or adjust the image tags.
-   The content is directly extracted and formatted; further editing and refinement are recommended to ensure accuracy and readability.

**File Summary, Directory Structure, and Files sections from code1.txt are omitted as they are not part of the manual's content.**

**The content from `code2.txt`, `code3.txt`, and `code4.txt` will need to be manually reviewed and inserted into the relevant "[Content of...]" placeholders in the Markdown document based on the section titles and context.**```markdown
