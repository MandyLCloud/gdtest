### 4.3 System Information

#### Computer System Information

Hardware and Computer Hardware Configuration. The following diagram illustrates the architecture of LSCP for production site and UAT site.

[TODO: Insert System Architecture Diagram]

The following diagram illustrates the architecture of LSCP for Production site and UAT site in another perspective.

[TODO: Insert System Architecture Diagram]

The internet connection is provided by an ISP Router

[TODO: Insert ISP Router details]

The setup is similar to the production and UAT site, but with one VM host server in the DMZ and trusted zone, and the role of SAN Storage is taken over by the Backup Server.

The diagram below illustrates the physical setup.

A site-to-site connection network is available, which allows SAN storage and backup server to transfer incremental data backup from production site to DR site, and recover data in opposite direction upon restoration from DR site.

## 6. Health Check

#### Abnormal case

Taking System Dumps

The LSCP database backup and control file backup is used for data backup and recovery of the SQL Server database to the control file. Please refer to Section 8.

#### Checking the Air-Conditioning System/Power Supply System

Whenever there is a check on the air-conditioning system or power supplies system, LSCP support staff shall follow the procedures in Section 6 to switch off the hardware and all the LSCP VM and physical servers, and then power on and load the server systems up again.

#### Fault Reporting Procedures

Maintenance team shall submit a fault report to the BD office to report the problem.

#### First Line System Crash/Communication Faults Diagnosis

##### First Line System Crash Diagnosis

Maintenance team is responsible for the first line system crash diagnosis. Since most of the error messages in the LSCP application will be logged down in the ?System Log? or ?Application Log? in the Microsoft Event Viewer, LSCP support staff shall check all the error messages in the ?System Log? and ?Application Log?. After LSCP Support staff has identified the cause of the problem, he/she shall take proper action to inform the corresponding technical support for attention to the problem and resolve the problem.

##### System Prompts/Exception Handling

Whenever there is a system or application error messages pop up on the console, LSCP support staff shall determine whether the problem is critical or not. In case of critical system error encountered that would seriously affect the production LSCP application service, LSCP support staff shall take proper action to inform the corresponding technical support for attention to the problem and resolve the problem.

##### Communication Faults Diagnosis

Maintenance team could check the status of the connection of each server by using the standard ?ping? command to ping the IP address (refer to section 5.3.3) of each server. If LSCP support staff can remote the server but haven?t got any response when pinging by another server, the problem shall be on the network. LSCP support staff shall contact MC to fix the problem as soon as possible. For Intranet LSCP, LSCP support staff shall contact BD-network supporting staff to fix the problem as soon as possible.

#### Create Certificate and Endpoint

1.  Run in prd-db-02

```sql
use master
create master key encryption by password = ' ?your password? ',
go
```

```sql
use master
create certificate prd_db_02_10yrs_cert
with subject = 'prd-db-02-10yrs cert for availability group'
expiry_date = '20331231';
go
```

```sql
use master
create endpoint endpoint_availabilitygroup
state = started
as tcp
(
listener_port = 5022, listener_ip = all
)
for database_mirroring
(
authentication = certificate prd_db_02_10yrs_cert,
encryption = required algorithm aes,
role = all
);
go
```

```sql
use master
backup certificate prd_db_02_10yrs_cert
to file = 'c:\source\prd_db_02_10yrs_cert.cer';
go
```

```sql
use master
create login login_availabilitygroup
with password = ' ?your password? ';
go
```

```sql
use master
create user login_availabilitygroup
for login login_availabilitygroup
go
```

2.  Copy the certificate 'c:\source\prd_db_02_10yrs_cert.cer' to prd-db-01 c:\source

3.  Open a new query on prd-db-02 and perform the following query one by one.

```sql
use master
create certificate prd_db_01_10yrs_cert
authorisation login_availabilitygroup
from file = 'c:\source\prd_db_01_10yrs_cert.cer'
go
```

```sql
use master
grant connect on endpoint::endpoint_availabilitygroup
to [login_availabilitygroup];
go
```

4.  Open a new query on prd-db-01 and perform the following query one by one.

```sql
use master
create certificate prd_db_02_10yers_cert
authorisation login_availabilitygroup
from file = 'c:\source\prd_db_02_10yrs_cert.cer'
go
```

```sql
use master
grant connect on endpoint::endpoint_availabilitygroup
to [login_availabilitygroup];
go
```

#### Backup Database

1.  Launch Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio on prd-db-01 and connect to prd-db-01.

2.  Create New Database by right clicking Databases -> New Database.

3.  Input Database name and click OK.
