# Handover Plan for Licensing Self-Certification Portal (LSCP)

This Handover Plan outlines the process for transitioning the Licensing Self-Certification Portal (LSCP) from the development team, Master Concept (Hong Kong) Limited (MC), to the Buildings Department (BD) for ongoing maintenance and support.  This plan ensures a smooth transition and equips BD with the necessary information and resources to effectively manage the LSCP.

## 1. Introduction

The LSCP project has reached the stage where the system is ready to be handed over from the development team (MC) to the Buildings Department (BD). This document serves as the official Handover Plan, detailing the procedures, timelines, and deliverables required for a successful transition.  This handover encompasses documentation, source code, administrative accounts, system backups, hardware, and software licenses.

## 2. Handover Purpose and Scope

### 2.1 Purpose

This Handover Plan aims to:

* Provide a comprehensive checklist of handover materials within the project scope.
* Equip the BD support and maintenance staff with the necessary information to maintain the LSCP.
* Ensure all deliverables are received by BD from MC.
* Facilitate a smooth and efficient transition of the LSCP from development to support.

### 2.2 Scope

This Handover Plan covers the following key areas:

* **Documentation:**  All relevant project documentation, including technical specifications, user manuals, and test results.
* **Program Source Code:**  Complete source code for the backend application, frontend web application, and frontend mobile application.
* **Administration Accounts:**  A complete list of administrative accounts for managing different areas of the LSCP.
* **System Backup:**  Procedures and schedules for backing up the LSCP system and data.
* **Hardware:**  Details of the physical and virtual hardware infrastructure supporting the LSCP.
* **Software Licenses:**  Information on all licensed software used in the LSCP.


## 3. System Overview

The LSCP is a web-based platform designed to streamline site inspection and site monitoring processes.  It allows BD officers and public users involved in site inspection and monitoring to provide, manage, and review inspection and monitoring records. The system architecture consists of a combination of on-premise infrastructure at West Kowloon Government Offices (WKGO) and cloud-based infrastructure on the Government Cloud Infrastructure Services (GCIS).  The system leverages technologies such as React, ExpressJS, NodeJS, and Microsoft SQL Server.  Key integrations include iAM Smart for authentication and connections to MWMS and BCIS for data exchange.  The system supports various web browsers and offers features like user account management, TCP assignment, form submission, and reporting.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities
