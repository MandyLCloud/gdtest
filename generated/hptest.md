## 1. Introduction

This Handover Plan outlines the process for transitioning the Licensing Self-Certification Portal (LSCP) from the development team (Master Concept (Hong Kong) Limited - MC) to the Buildings Department (BD) for operation and maintenance. This document serves as a checklist of handover materials and provides essential information for the support and maintenance staff.  This is Stage 1 of the document generation.

## 2. Purpose and Scope

### 2.1 Purpose

This plan aims to ensure a smooth and efficient handover of the LSCP, encompassing all necessary documentation, source code, administrative accounts, backups, hardware, and software licenses.  The goal is to equip the BD with the resources and knowledge required to effectively manage and support the system post-handover.

### 2.2 Scope

This plan covers the handover of the following key components:

1.  Documentation (Technical, User, Operational)
2.  Program Source Code (Backend, Frontend Web App, Frontend Mobile App)
3.  Administration Accounts
4.  System Backups (VM and Database)
5.  Hardware Infrastructure (Servers, Network Devices, Storage)
6.  Software Licenses and Packages

## 3. System Overview

The LSCP is a platform for site inspection and site monitoring personnel to provide, manage, and review inspection and monitoring records.  It caters to both BD officers and public users involved in these processes. The system architecture comprises a multi-tiered setup with components deployed across on-premise (WKGO) and cloud (GCIS) environments. Key features include:

*   User authentication (password, iAM Smart, Departmental Portal)
*   TCP assignment and management
*   Inspection form and site monitoring scheme management
*   Site project creation and management
*   Supervision plan management
*   Data integration with MWMS and BCIS
*   Notification system (email, OTP)

For detailed system architecture and functionality, refer to the System Manual.
