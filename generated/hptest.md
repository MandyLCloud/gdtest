## 1. Introduction

This Handover Plan outlines the process for transitioning the Licensing Self-Certification Portal (LSCP) from the development team, Master Concept (Hong Kong) Limited (MC), to the Buildings Department (BD) for ongoing maintenance and support. This document serves as a checklist of handover materials and provides essential information for the support staff.  This is Stage 1 of the document generation.

## 2. Purpose and Scope

This Handover Plan aims to ensure a smooth and efficient transfer of the LSCP to the BD.  The scope includes all deliverables within the project scope, specifically:

* Documentation
* Program Source Code (Backend Application, Frontend Web App, Frontend Mobile App)
* Administration Accounts
* System Backup
* Hardware
* Software Packages and Licenses

## 3. System Overview

The LSCP is a platform for site inspection and site monitoring personnel to provide, manage, and review inspection and monitoring records. The system architecture is distributed across on-premise infrastructure at West Kowloon Government Offices (WKGO) and the Government Cloud Infrastructure Services (GCIS).  It caters to both internal BD users and external public users. Key features include:

* **User Authentication:** Supports password-based authentication, iAM Smart integration, and Departmental Portal integration.
* **TCP Management:** Facilitates assignment and management of Technical Competent Persons (TCPs).
* **Site Project Management:** Enables creation, editing, and viewing of site project details and supervision plans.
* **Form and Scheme Management:** Allows listing and management of inspection forms and site-monitoring schemes.
* **Data Integration:** Interfaces with MWMS and BCIS for data synchronization.
