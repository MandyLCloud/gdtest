## Appendix: System Manual Summary

The following is a summary of the System Manual (sm_i1.md). Please refer to the System Manual document for complete and up-to-date information.

### 1. Purpose

The objective of this document is to provide an overview of the system
by listing out in brief the programs, data files, equipment, clerical
procedure, computer operation procedure, etc. Reader interested in
specific area may refer to the corresponding manuals (Data Manual,
Program Manual, etc.).

The major readers of System Manual are the staff responsible for
maintaining the application system.

### 2. Scope

The System Manual provides a general overview of the software and
hardware configurations for LSCP, and shows the system environment
details such as applications configurations, server and workstation
information and backup services.

In addition, some major system parameters, system configuration files
and the system inventory are enclosed in the Appendices.

The major readers of this document are the staff responsible for
maintaining the application system. Readers interested in specific area
may refer to the corresponding manuals (Data Manual, Program Manual,
etc.).

### 3. System Summary

#### 3.1 Objective

The users of the LSCP can be classified into two categories:

-   BD Officers

-   Public users involved in site inspection and site monitoring

The primary objective of LSCP is to provide an electronic platform for
site inspection and site monitoring personnel to provide, manage, and
review the inspection and monitoring records.

#### 3.2 System Architecture

This is an overview of the system structure of LSCP in the Production
Environment.

![System Architecture](media/image2.png)

The following diagram illustrates the architecture of the LSCP for
Production site and UAT site in another perspective.

![System Architecture](media/image3.png)

The system is holding on two datacenters: On-premise (WKGO) and
Government Cloud Infrastructure Services (GCIS).

The On-premise system is behind an internal firewall that uses NAT to
separate into 3 subnets. There are Production, UAT and DEV for internal
users only.

A reverse proxy server with load balancing function is used for
increased security and share the incoming requests to the frontend web
servers.

The system on GCIS is divided into 3 subnets: Internet DMZ (iDMZ),
Trusted Zone and Gnet DMZ (gDMZ).

Both iDMZ and gDMZ contain a reverse proxy server and a Web Application
Firewall (WAF) also deployed in front of the iDMZ for increased security
access.

External users (i.e. public users) access the system from the internet
through the internet using LSCP Web Application, which interacts with
the Application Server through the reverse proxy server. The Application
Server hosts the static web interface files.

To perform system logic, the External Application Servers will pass
requests to the Web Servers in the Trusted Zone. The web application,
written in reactjs, will interact with the external web server that is
written in nodeJS that in turns perform CRUD on the Database Servers,
which host Microsoft SQL Servers, and the in-built file storage to
perform logic computing, and return result to the External Web Servers
then to the internet.

In addition to external users, internal users who would access the
internal BDSCS application from BD intranet, would connect to the BD Web
Servers in the Trusted Zone, through the Departmental Portal (OSDP). The
BD Web Servers perform the same function as the External Web Servers and
perform user authentication functions when interfaced with the
Departmental Portal.

Finally, there are some more servers in the Trusted Zone to support
internal BDSCS application, which includes:

-   Log Server to store the system and application log from other
    > servers

-   File Server to store the temporary and permanent files

-   Database Server that hosts Microsoft SQL server to store all the
    > system and user information

-   vCenter Server to manage the VM Hypervisors on each of the physical
    > servers

-   Backup Server to keep snapshots of the database

Below are further details of each of the system components in the BDSCS:

<u>External Application Server</u>

The external application servers serve the static web contents in form
of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the internet, through Microsoft's
Internet Information Services (IIS), and also proxy the backend APIs
(GraphQL format) to the web application servers as being in the DMZ.

The website hosted on the external web servers is written in JavaScript
under the React framework. After compiling the JavaScript project, the
result files are stored in the external web servers and served by IIS,
with rewrite rules to proxy the backend APIs.

<u>External Web Server</u>

The external web server, in this context, refers to a server that hosts
and runs the backend API responsible for processing business logic and
performing database operations. In the case of IIS (Internet Information
Services) and expressJS, IIS serves as the web server software, while
ExpressJS represents the framework used for developing the backend
APIs.

The backend API, developed using ExpressJS, encompasses the code that
handles various tasks, including interacting with databases, executing
business logic, and processing requests from clients. It acts as the
intermediary between the frontend (such as a mobile or web application)
and the underlying data storage.

When a client application makes a request to the backend API, IIS
receives the request and passes it to the appropriate ExpressJS code for
processing. The backend API then performs the necessary operations,
which may involve querying the database, executing business rules, or
performing calculations. Once the processing is complete, the backend
API generates a response that is sent back to the client application
(External Application Server in this case) through IIS.

<u>BD Web Servers</u>

The BDSCS backend portal was developed for internal BD users and BD ITU.
It is using the same technology stack as Extra Application Server but
just deployed to different zones to ensure security and connectivity for
internal BD users only

<u>Database Management Servers</u>

Both the internal and external BDSCS applications are built on the
Microsoft SQL Server database engine.

<u>Web Browser Support</u>

![Web Browser Support](media/image4.png)

<u>iAM Smart</u>

The iAM Smart system implemented by the Government of Hong Kong focuses
primarily on providing a secure and convenient login mechanism and
retrieving basic user information. Pilot CDPSS has integrated with iAM
Smart authentication module. Users can utilize iAM Smart to log in to
Pilot CDPSS services and retrieve basic information associated with
their digital identity.

<u>Departmental Portal</u>

The Departmental Portal is a web service of BD to pass BD user?s
identity to other wb services including the LSCP. When BD users access
LSCP website through the Departmental Portal, the user ID will be
provided to the LSCP to complete the login process without further input
from the user. This login method only available inside BD?s network.

<u>SMTPX</u>

The notification module in BDSCS would send login one-time password
(OTP) and email notification by initiating an SMTPX service provided by
CIS.

<u>MWMS</u>

MWMS would provide data of AP/RSE/RGE/AS acknowledged by BD. Snapshots
of the MWMS data will be interfaced to BDSCS through SFTP and then
internal and external BDSCS applications would intake this data by
processing the batch file auto-generated and delivered from MWMS daily.

<u>BCIS</u>

BCIS would provide address data and BD case data acknowledged by BD. The
latest copy of the BCIS database would be synced to BDSCS through SQL
queries at midnight. The data would then be used in both external and
internal portals for address selection, folio management, and case
logic. Meanwhile, the new BD cases would be synced to BCIS in real time
through a SQL stored procedure.

This is an overview of the system structure of Pilot CDPSS in Disaster
Recovery Environment, similar with the production environment
