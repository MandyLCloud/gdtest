## 1. Introduction

This Handover Plan outlines the process for transitioning the Licensing Self-Certification Portal (LSCP) from the development team, Master Concept (Hong Kong) Limited (MC), to the Buildings Department (BD) for ongoing maintenance and support. This document serves as a checklist of handover materials and provides essential information for the support staff.


## 2. Purpose and Scope

This Handover Plan aims to ensure a smooth and efficient transfer of the LSCP to the BD.  The scope includes all deliverables within the project scope, specifically:

* **Documentation:** System Manual, User Manual, Administrator Manual, Technical Design Document, Deployment Guide, Troubleshooting Guide, API Documentation.
* **Program Source Code:** Backend Application, Frontend Web App, Frontend Mobile App (including all libraries and dependencies).
* **Administration Accounts:**  A list of all administrator accounts with corresponding privileges and access levels.
* **System Backup:** Procedures and scripts for performing system backups and restoration, including a recent full backup of the system.
* **Hardware:**  Specifications and inventory of all hardware components, including servers, network devices, and storage.  If applicable, details of access and management procedures for the hardware.
* **Software Packages and Licenses:** A list of all software packages and licenses required for the operation and maintenance of the LSCP, including version numbers and license keys.


## 3. System Overview

The LSCP is a platform for site inspection and site monitoring personnel to provide, manage, and review inspection and monitoring records. The system architecture is distributed across on-premise infrastructure at West Kowloon Government Offices (WKGO) and the Government Cloud Infrastructure Services (GCIS).  It caters to both internal BD users and external public users. Key features include:

* **User Authentication:** Supports password-based authentication, iAM Smart integration, and Departmental Portal integration.
* **TCP Management:** Facilitates assignment and management of Technical Competent Persons (TCPs).
* **Site Project Management:** Enables creation, editing, and viewing of site project details and supervision plans.
* **Form and Scheme Management:** Allows listing and management of inspection forms and site-monitoring schemes.
* **Data Integration:** Interfaces with MWMS and BCIS for data synchronization.
