# Program Manual

## 1. Introduction

This Program Manual provides a comprehensive overview of the software utilized within the Licensing Self-Certification Portal (LSCP). It details the system's programs, data files, and other key components. This manual is intended for staff responsible for maintaining the application system.

## 2. Scope

This manual serves as a guide to understanding the software intricacies within the LSCP. It includes detailed program specifications for each program integrated into the system. The program specifications are prepared by system analysts during the Implementation Phase to guide programmers during coding and to facilitate future maintenance.

The project team should customize this manual to reflect any unique characteristics of the software development environment, such as event handling mechanisms or message passing protocols. If no new programs are being developed, the preparation of a Program Manual may not be necessary.
